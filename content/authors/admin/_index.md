      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hello, I'm Rahul Garg!
 
I am a researcher with a penchant for designing behavior paradigms and deciphering the brainwide neural logic of those behaviors. My research aims to rethink behavioral studies of attentional dysfunction and impulsive aggression in mice so that they reflect daily human experiences and struggles. 

I am currently a graduate student at the Stowers institute for medical research with [Dr. Ron Yu's group](https://research.stowers.org/yulab/)  which works on sensory system neuroscience. Here, I work with interdisciplinary group of people combining ideas from development of neural circuits, regeneration, imaging sytems to physiology. 

In my research, I like to explain experimental findings, both behavioral and physiological, using theoretical frameworks including neural network and generalized linear models. For empirical data, I rely on neuromodulatory sensors, calcium imaging, neuropixel recordings when mice perform head-fixed or freely moving social behaviors.
